# Project Description

1. [Connect4_AI](https://github.com/kslukin/toy_projects/tree/main/Connect4_AI)

This project models Connect Four as a dynamic decision-making problem, implementing an AI agent that applies minimax search with alpha-beta pruning to traverse the game tree efficiently. The evaluation function captures spatial heuristics by quantifying weighted positional advantages, enabling the agent to prioritize moves with latent win potential. Deep copies of board states (copy module) ensure safe recursive search, while injected randomness (random module) disrupts deterministic patterns, fostering a more human-like and less predictable opponent. The focus lies on state-space pruning, heuristic-driven evaluation, and stochastic control to simulate intelligent, adaptive behavior under computational constraints.

This project was inspired by a challenge proposed on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/minimax-connect-four), which provided the foundation for creating a more advanced, AI-powered version of the classic game.
